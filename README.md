Drupal a popular CMS ( Content Management System ) is used to build websites. There are actually three fields where you can work
on drupal these are :-
  1) Site Designing
  2) Theme Designing
  3) Module Development

Among these three this project is about the module develoment.I have developed a module to perform basic functions like
  1) Load node based on id entered. ( HARD-CODING)
  2)hook_help function implementation
  3)hook_permission function implementation
  4)hook_form function implementation
  5)form validate implementation
  6)hook_menu implememntation
  7)Function calling
  8)Cheecking form on submittion
  9)t and render funtions
  10)Creating blocks in drupal

If you are not sure about how these functions work I suggest to visit Drupal API Documentation.Link is given below:
                  
                  https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal
